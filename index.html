							<h2>About Me<br />
							</h2>
						</header>
						<p>
							My journey in data analytics started when I became curious about data and was fascinated by how it is used in the real world. As I explored the power of data to provide meaningful insights, I was motivated to make a career change from a licensed electronics engineer to a data analyst. I wanted to use my analytical skills and creativity to help businesses make informed decisions based on data-driven insights. <br />
							<br />
							
							Throughout my career, I have actively developed my communication and analytical skills through various experiences. These include analyzing reports and providing insightful recommendations, reviewing project workplans to ensure alignment with changing needs and objectives, actively engaging in client meetings to better understand specific requirements, and carefully examining customer concerns to determine the most suitable course of action to address them. These experiences have allowed me to strengthen my ability to effectively communicate and analyze information in order to drive successful outcomes. <br />
							<br />
							I'm determined to launch a successful career as a data analyst. To achieve this goal, I have dedicated my time and effort to complete my training in Google Data Analytics. You can verify my professional certificate from the program <a href="https://coursera.org/verify/professional-cert/KCKV2VRV5ELZ">here.  </a>  This training has equipped me with essential skills in areas such as spreadsheets, SQL, Tableau, and R, which are fundamental to the role of a data analyst. To further enhance my skills, I am currently undergoing a Python training on Udemy. I am fully committed to studying and participating in additional training programs to become a proficient data analyst.
